Stephen's version of the Kickr Bike Display

Maybe I’m strange, but I found the gear display of 1-7 didn’t mean much to me so I have created a version (yes, another version…), starting with Claus Jensen’s one, that maps this on to the actual gears, so shows 39-23 (for example).

I’ve built into the code standard chainring and cassette types (34/50, 39/53, 12-28T, 11-30T etc) and have set it up so you can switch between them using the buttons (top button cycles through the chainrings and bottom button cycles through the cassettes). 

The current selected values are shown on the display and persist between restarts (they are stored as preferences in the unit).
